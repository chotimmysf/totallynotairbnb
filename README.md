BACKSTORY

This project was inspired by the "AirBnB Clone" project in this <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/css-grid-flexbox-the-ultimate-course-build-10-projects/learn/lecture/12971992#overview" target="_blank">Udemy CSS Course. </a>

PROJECT JOURNEY INSIGHTS

While doing this project, I further explored CSS grid elements and how they can be applied alongside CSS flex box elements. I learned how to turn span text into psuedo-buttons(the dark green "NEW!" buttons). I also started to learn how to incorporate Javascript into my HTML/CSS document by using JS to create a simple toggle animation for the site's footer section.

APP OVERVIEW

(Locations) Reccomended for You: Six cards, with each card composing of an image and white text caption on the bottom of the image.

Explore San Francisco: 8 cards color-coded by type of event (ex. purple is used to highlight sports-related events).

Terms, Privacy, Currency: Javascript-powered button feature that displays the terms and conditions of the website when clicked. The button can be clicked again to close the terms and conditions.

TECHNOLOGIES USED

HTML

CSS

CHALLENGES

Javascript Function: The event listener I added did not seem to include the script I wrote at first, so I rewrote the script while also changing the event listener from () => to e =>.

CSS Reference: When creating the project, I left a space between .footer and .active, which did not allow my JS script to load the footer at all.

Social Media Icons: I was stuck wondering why the Twitter icon would not show up on my web app, but due to my way of importing the FA icon, I had to include an asterick in the reference of the CSS that corresponds to it, as adding the asterick made the Twitter icon show up.

Inexperience and Time Management: Unsure of what actual technologies, time, and effort behind Javascript. Took an extra week to slowly watch the Udemy course videos to hear and see grid elements in action. App development took 3 weeks, rather than the targeted 2 weeks scope.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

Refine Skills: Review HTML/CSS elements/functions

CSS Carousel: I was planning to add carousel elements for the "Explore San Francisco" and "Top-rated experiences" sections, but due to relative inexperience with CSS grid elements and time constraints, I held off on adding carousel elements for these two sections, which currently appear as long strings of cards.
